Modified Multiscale Semantic Segmentation Network for Multi-level Seismic Damage Features of PC Structures

Overview

This repository provides an implementation of a modified multiscale semantic segmentation network designed to analyze multi-level seismic damage features in precast Concrete (PC) structures. The network architecture incorporates specialized modifications to better capture hierarchical damage patterns caused by seismic events, improving upon existing semantic segmentation approaches for structural damage assessment.

Key Features

Multiscale feature extraction mechanism tailored for seismic damage patterns

Modified network architecture accounting for hierarchical damage characteristics

Enhanced segmentation precision for PC structure damage assessment

Adaptive processing of multi-level seismic damage features
